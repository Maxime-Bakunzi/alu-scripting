# Reddit API Projects

This repository contains Python scripts that interact with the Reddit API to perform various tasks. Each script is designed to fulfill a specific requirement and demonstrates the usage of different features of the Reddit API.

## Project 0: How many subs?

The `0-subs.py` script queries the Reddit API and returns the number of subscribers for a given subreddit. It uses the `requests` module for sending HTTP requests to the Reddit API.

Usage:
```bash
python3 0-main.py <subreddit>
```


## Project 1: Top Ten

The `1-top_ten.py` script queries the Reddit API and prints the titles of the first 10 hot posts listed for a given subreddit. It uses the `requests` module for sending HTTP requests to the Reddit API.

Usage:
```bash
python3 1-main.py <subreddit>
```


## Project 2: Recurse it!

The `2-recurse.py` script recursively queries the Reddit API and returns a list containing the titles of all hot articles for a given subreddit. It uses the `requests` module for sending HTTP requests to the Reddit API.

Usage:
```bash
python3 2-main.py <subreddit>
```


## Project 3: Count it!

The `3-count.py` script recursively queries the Reddit API, parses the titles of all hot articles, and prints a sorted count of given keywords. It uses the `requests` module for sending HTTP requests to the Reddit API.

Usage:
```bash
python3 3-main.py <subreddit> <list of keywords>
```
